## Getting Started

You'll need to have an account with [DataDome](https://datadome.co/free-signup/). Once that's done, copy the `.env.example` file in this directory to `.env.local` (which will be ignored by Git):

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Then open `.env.local` and set the environment variables to match the ones in your DataDome dashboard. Your keys should be available at https://app.datadome.co/dashboard/config/protection/keys

Next, run Next.js in development mode:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

# or

yarn
yarn dev
```

Deploy it to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=edge-middleware-eap) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).
